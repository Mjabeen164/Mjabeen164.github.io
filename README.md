## ⭐ Featured Projects

### 1. 🫁 Smoking-Related Health Risk Analysis
![Smoking Dashboard](assets/images/smoking-dashboard.png)  
**Domain:** Healthcare Analytics | **Tools:** SQL, Power BI  
**Problem:** Understand how smoking duration and intensity impacts different vital organs and overall health risk.  
**What I Did:**
- Modeled and analyzed smoking behavior, demographics, and organ-level health indicators using SQL  
- Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to compare risk across organs, age groups, and smoking patterns  
**Key Insight:** Smoking-related health risks are systemic rather than isolated, increasing sharply with longer smoking duration and higher daily intake — particularly among older populations.

**Domain:** Business Analytics | **Tools:** SQL, Power BI  
**Problem:** Sales were growing, but profitability was inconsistent across categories and regions.  
**What I Did:**
- Analyzed revenue, profit, discounting, and product performance  
- Designed dashboards to track margin erosion and identify loss-making categories  
**Key Insight:** High revenue does not guarantee profitability — aggressive discounting significantly reduced margins in multiple categories.

### 3. 👥 HR Analytics Dashboard

**Domain:** People Analytics | **Tools:** Power BI  
**Problem:** Identify patterns driving employee attrition and department-level retention risk.  
**What I Did:**
- Analyzed employee tenure, attrition trends, and departmental distribution  
- Built a Power BI dashboard to highlight high-risk segments  
**Key Insight:** Early-tenure employees and specific departments consistently show higher attrition risk, pointing to onboarding and role-fit gaps.
